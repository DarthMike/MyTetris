# Tetris Remade

## Overview

I made this game as an introduction to game programming and development. It is just that, a fresh and simple tetris game, albeit, quite hard on purpose... do you think you are good enough to make at least 20000 points? Try...

##Platforms

* Windows

## Features
* Indielib integration
* Simple Tetris prototype
* Simple Menu screen

## Playing it
- Use "Arrow Keys" to move the falling piece around.
- Use "Z" to rotate the piece
- Use "X" to throw piece down
- Make as many points as possible eliminating complete lines before the board is full of badly positioned pieces!
